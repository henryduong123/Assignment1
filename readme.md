# **LEVER**
### The Lineage Editing and Validation tool

**Please note that there is a completely new version of LEVER currently in development.
This project, knows as 'lever.js' unifies the 2-D and 3-D LEVER algorithms in a 
new software architecture that is better, faster, stronger, etc.**

**The software will be released publically early-mid 2018. A collaborator/developer
preview will be available fall 2017. Please contact Andy Cohen (https://bioimage.coe.drexel.edu) if you're interested 
in learning more about the new version.**


LEVER (lineage editing and validation) is a set of software tools for analyzing 
time-lapse microscopy images of proliferating cells. LEVER includes algorithms for 
segmenting, tracking and lineaging. LEVER also includes a novel validation 
interface that makes any errors in the automated results easy to identify and quick
to correct.
