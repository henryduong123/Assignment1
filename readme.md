# **LEVER**
### The Lineage Editing and Validation tool

**Please note that there is a completely new version of LEVER currently in development.
This project, knows as 'lever.js' unifies the 2-D and 3-D LEVER algorithms in a 
new software architecture that is better, faster, stronger, etc.**

** Please contact Andy Cohen (https://bioimage.coe.drexel.edu) if you're interested 
in learning more about the new version.**

The original lever software can be found in the 'archive' branch on this server, 
but it is strongly suggested that you use the new version instead!

LEVER (lineage editing and validation) is a set of software tools for analyzing 
time-lapse microscopy images of proliferating cells. LEVER includes algorithms for 
segmenting, tracking and lineaging. LEVER also includes a novel validation 
interface that makes any errors in the automated results easy to identify and quick
to correct.
